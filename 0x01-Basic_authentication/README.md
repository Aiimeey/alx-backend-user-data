Basic Authentication Project

This project focuses on implementing Basic Authentication for a simple API using Python and Flask. Authentication is a fundamental aspect of secure web applications, allowing users to access protected resources by providing their credentials.
Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will gain a solid understanding of:

    What authentication means in the context of web development.
    How Basic Authentication works, including encoding credentials with Base64.
    Implementing Basic Authentication using Flask and Python.
    Securing API endpoints and handling authorization errors.

Project Structure

The project consists of several tasks, each building upon the previous one to create a fully functional Basic Authentication system. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of what each task entails:

    Error Handlers: Implementing error handlers for 401 (Unauthorized) and 403 (Forbidden) responses.
    Auth Class: Creating an Auth class to manage authentication requirements.
    Request Validation: Implementing request validation to ensure secure API access.
    BasicAuth Class: Creating a BasicAuth class that extends Auth for Basic Authentication.
    Base64 Handling: Implementing methods to handle Base64 encoding and decoding for Basic Authentication.
    User Credentials: Validating and retrieving user credentials from Base64 encoded strings.
    User Object Retrieval: Implementing methods to retrieve and validate user objects based on credentials.
    Integration and Testing: Integrating authentication mechanisms into the Flask application and testing API endpoints.

Resources

For a deeper understanding, consider exploring resources on REST API Authentication Mechanisms, Base64 encoding, Flask framework, and HTTP Authorization headers.
