Introduction to User Authentication Service

In the realm of web development, user authentication stands as a foundational pillar of secure and personalized user experiences. The User Authentication Service project delves into the intricacies of implementing a robust authentication system using Python and Flask, supplemented by SQLAlchemy for database interactions and bcrypt for password hashing.
Project Overview

This project is structured into several key components, each focusing on fundamental aspects of authentication:

    Database Management: Utilizing SQLAlchemy, a powerful SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python, to manage the user database.

    Password Security: Implementing secure password storage using bcrypt, a strong cryptographic hashing function designed to protect user credentials.

    Flask Web Framework: Creating a RESTful API with Flask, a lightweight yet versatile web framework, to handle user registration, login sessions, and profile management.

    Session Management: Implementing session management to authenticate users across different web requests securely.

Learning Objectives

By engaging with this project, you will:

    Gain proficiency in setting up Flask routes to handle API requests.
    Learn how to integrate bcrypt for secure password hashing.
    Understand SQLAlchemy's ORM capabilities for database operations.
    Implement robust error handling and response codes using HTTP status codes.
    Explore the importance of session management in maintaining user authentication state.

Project Structure

The project is organized into tasks that incrementally build upon each other, starting from defining database models to implementing endpoints for user registration, login, session management, and profile retrieval. Each task focuses on specific functionalities required for a complete user authentication system.
Technologies Used

    Python 3.7: Core programming language for application logic.
    Flask: Micro web framework for building web applications in Python.
    SQLAlchemy: ORM library for interacting with relational databases.
    bcrypt: Library for secure password hashing.
